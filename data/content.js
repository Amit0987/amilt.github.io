The goal was to move beyond a headline attrition rate and uncover which roles, departments, satisfaction levels, and career patterns drive voluntary exits.\n\n## Dataset\n\n- 1,470 employee records with 35 attributes\n- Overall attrition rate: 16.1%\n- Key variables: job role, department, years at company, monthly income, job satisfaction, overtime, marital status, and distance from home\n\n## Python EDA\n\n- Profiled the dataset using Pandas — no missing values, but several columns needed type casting and label encoding.\n- Used Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualise distributions, correlation heatmaps, and attrition breakdowns by every categorical variable.\n- Ran a point-biserial correlation analysis to surface the strongest numerical predictors of attrition.\n- Found that OverTime, JobSatisfaction, MonthlyIncome, and YearsAtCompany are the four strongest individual predictors.\n\n## Power BI Dashboard\n\n- Built a two-page report: an **Overview** page with attrition KPIs and department breakdowns, and a **Deep Dive** page with role and satisfaction-level filters.\n- Created DAX measures for attrition rate, average tenure of leavers vs. stayers, and income gap between churned and retained employees.\n- Added conditional formatting to highlight high-risk role-department combinations in table visuals.\n\n## Key Findings\n\n- Employees who work overtime are 3× more likely to leave than those who do not.\n- Sales Representatives have the highest attrition rate at 39.8%.\n- Employees earning below the 25th percentile income threshold leave at nearly double the company-average rate.\n- Employees with fewer than 2 years at the company account for 40% of all exits.\n- Low job-satisfaction employees leave at 22.8% — almost double the rate of highly satisfied staff.\n\n## Business Recommendations\n\n- Introduce overtime monitoring and compensatory policies for high-risk roles.\n- Review the compensation structure for entry-level and Sales Representative bands.\n- Implement a structured onboarding and 90-day check-in programme to retain new joiners during the highest-risk window."

      "body": "A single compliance figure tells you how often you hit the target. It does not tell you where the misses cluster, which categories are dragging the number down, or whether the same root cause is repeating every month.\n\n## Ask Where, Not Just How Many\n\nSplit the same number by category, priority, and turnaround band and the picture changes completely. Misses are rarely spread evenly across all ticket types. In most service desks I have analysed, 60–70% of SLA breaches come from fewer than 20% of the categories.\n\nOnce you know which categories breach most often, you can ask a much sharper question: is it a volume problem, a staffing problem, or a process problem?\n\n## Then Ask What Repeats\n\nA one-off breach in a low-volume category is noise. A breach that returns in the same category, at the same point in the month, for three consecutive months is a signal.\n\nThe real win is identifying causes that repeat. That is where the biggest sustainable improvement lives — not in chasing individual outliers.\n\n## A Simple Framework\n\n- **Headline rate** — the number everyone already knows.\n- **Category breakdown** — which 20% of categories account for 60–70% of breaches?\n- **Priority split** — are P1/P2 tickets being sacrificed to hit volume targets on P3/P4?\n- **Trend view** — is the breach rate improving, stable, or worsening month-on-month?\n- **Root cause recurrence** — which causes appeared in more than two consecutive months?\n\nThis five-step view takes about 15 minutes to build in any BI tool. It turns a headline compliance number into an actual action list."

      "body": "Every month the same cleaning steps ate hours: filters, lookups, copy and paste across four tabs, and a manual check to make sure nothing had shifted.\n\n## What the Monthly Process Looked Like\n\nThe raw data came from a ticketing system export. Before any analysis could happen, I had to:\n\n- Standardise category and priority field values (free-text source, so the same category had six different spellings).\n- Calculate turnaround time, accounting for business hours only.\n- Flag SLA breaches based on thresholds that varied by priority level.\n- Join the clean data against a team-assignment lookup table.\n- Output a summary table and a breach detail list.\n\nAll of that took around three hours every single month.\n\n## What I Automated\n\n- **Category and priority normalisation** using a regex-based mapping dictionary.\n- **Business-hours turnaround calculation** using Pandas date arithmetic and a custom working-hours function.\n- **SLA breach flagging** using a vectorised comparison against a threshold lookup.\n- **Team assignment join** using pd.merge — replacing the VLOOKUP chain entirely.\n- **Output generation** — summary CSV and breach detail file written automatically with a timestamp.\n\n## What Changed\n\nThe first run took about two days to build and test. By month two, the entire pipeline ran in under four minutes.\n\nTotal monthly time dropped by roughly 40% — not because the script is magic, but because it removed all the repetitive mechanical steps and left only the judgement work: interpreting results, spotting anomalies, writing commentary.\n\n## The Rule I Took Away\n\nIf you do the same sequence of steps more than twice, write down the logic. If you do it monthly, automate it. The upfront cost is real — the compounding return is much bigger."

      "body": "The hardest part of data visualisation is not making the chart — it is choosing the right one. A beautiful visual that answers the wrong question, or answers the right question in a confusing way, is worse than a plain table.\n\n## Start With the Question, Not the Data\n\nBefore opening Tableau or Power BI, I write down in one sentence what decision or question this visual needs to support. That sentence almost always maps to one of five relationships:\n\n- **Comparison** — how does A compare to B?\n- **Trend** — how has X changed over time?\n- **Composition** — what does the whole break down into?\n- **Distribution** — how is X spread across a range?\n- **Relationship** — does X correlate with Y?\n\nThe relationship type determines the chart family.\n\n## The Chart I Use for Each Relationship\n\n**Comparison** → Bar chart. Horizontal if labels are long; vertical if the x-axis represents dates.\n\n**Trend** → Line chart. Always. If someone asks for a bar chart for a trend, I push back.\n\n**Composition** → Stacked bar if I need to show both the total and the parts. Pie chart only if there are two or three segments with meaningfully different proportions — never for six or more categories.\n\n**Distribution** → Histogram for continuous data. Box plot when I need to show spread and outliers across multiple groups simultaneously.\n\n**Relationship** → Scatter plot. Add a trend line if the direction of the relationship is the point.\n\n## The Three Questions I Ask Before Finalising\n\n1. Can someone who has never seen this data understand the main point in under five seconds?\n2. Am I showing more dimensions than are necessary to answer the question?\n3. Would a table communicate this more clearly?\n\nIf the answer to question three is yes, I use a table.\n\n## The Most Common Mistake I See\n\nUsing a pie chart with more than four segments. At that point, the human eye cannot reliably compare the slices — especially the middle ones. A sorted horizontal bar chart does the job better every time.\n\n## One Principle Above All\n\nClarity is the goal. The best chart is the one that makes the answer obvious without requiring an explanation."
